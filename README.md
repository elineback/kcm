Going to write in Java since it would be easier for me.

First I am going to sketch out some ideas on what I need here in the ReadMe.
Second I will begin creating some objects and services to run in the main. 

Objects needed.
Elevator
- CurrentFloor
- Occupied
- Destination
- Trip(Summons or Taxing)
- TotalTrips
- TotalFloorsTravelled
- TripsTravelled
- Operational
Controllor
-TotalOfElevators
-TotalOfFloors

Controller Service

Start with two elevators.
